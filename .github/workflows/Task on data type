const birthday = '18.04.1982'; 
const age = someCode(birthday);

Here we have a constant birthday date and the age is calculated from birthday with the help of some code (it is not provided for shortness, and because details don’t matter here).

Would it be right to use upper case for birthday? For age? Or even for both?

*/
//yes i think it would be right as its easier to remember 'Birthday'
//than the actual date.

let name = "John"; 
// embed a variable 
alert( `Hello, ${name}!` ); 
// Hello, John!
 // embed an expression
 alert( `the result is ${1 + 2}` ); 
// the result is 3

What is the output of the script?

let name = "Ilya"; 
alert( `hello ${1}` ); // ? 
alert( `hello ${"name"}` ); // ? 
alert( `hello ${name}` ); // ?
